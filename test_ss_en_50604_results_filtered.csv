An appropriately sized conductor directly contacted to the battery cells of (20 +0/-10) mΩ shall be used to apply a “hard short” in less than one second for 10 min, or until another condition occurs that prevents completion of the test (e.g. component melting). The test shall be performed without integrated, passive and active protective devices for short circuit protection operational."
9.1.101.2,"Option 2 The DUT shall be at RT, fully charged and under normal operating conditions (main contactors are closed, battery systems are controlled by the BCU/BMS). An appropriately sized conductor of (20 +0/-10) mΩ shall be used to apply a “hard short” in less than one second for 10 min, or until another condition occurs that prevents completion of the test (e.g. component melting). The test shall be performed with integrated, passive and active protective passive short circuit protection devices operational The test shall be performed under test option 1 and 2 as described in 5.104.1 and 5.104.2 respectively."
9.1.102,"Requirements The overcurrent protection function for option 2, if any, shall disconnect the short circuit current. The DUT shall not exhibit any evidence of: disassembly or fire. The temperature of the battery casing shall not exceed 150 °C within 6 h."
