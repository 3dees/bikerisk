"This clause of Part 1 is applicable except as follows.
Battery chargers shall be marked with
– rated DC output voltage, in volts;
– rated DC output current, in amperes, however no other output current shall be marked;
– the rated current, in amperes, of protective devices incorporated in a DC distribution
– the polarity of the output terminals unless incorrect polarity connection is prevented. The
positive terminal shall be indicated by symbol IEC 60417-5005 (2002-10) and the negative
terminal by symbol IEC 60417-5006 (2002-10);
– the time-current characteristic of fuse-links of the time-lag type;
– !“Before charging, read the instructions” or symbol ISO 7000-0790 (2004-01); (not
required if the battery charger output is less than 20 VA);
– “For indoor use” or symbol IEC 60417-5957 (2004-12) or “Do not expose to rain” or symbol
IEC 60417-6062 (2011-05); (not required if the battery charger output is less than 20 VA or
the battery charger has a degree of protection against harmful ingress of water of at least
– the substance of the following, if the output is at least 20 VA and the battery charger is for
charging lead-acid batteries:
• disconnect the supply before making or breaking the connections to the battery;
• WARNING: Explosive gases. Prevent flames and sparks. Provide adequate
ventilation during charging.
Battery chargers incorporating an engine-cranking switch that allows the battery charger to
supply a supplementary starting current for the engine shall be marked with
– the maximum ""on"" time;
– the minimum ""off"" time or the maximum ratio between the ""on"" time and the ""off"" time.
If the battery charger can be adjusted to different rated DC output voltages, the output voltage
to which the battery charger is adjusted shall be clearly discernible.

!The instructions shall
– state that during charging, the battery must be placed in a well-ventilated area (for chargers
for batteries that release gases into the atmosphere during normal charging);
– state that the battery charger must only be plugged into an earthed socket-outlet (for
portable class I battery chargers for outdoor use);
– explain the automatic function, stating any limitation (for automatic battery chargers).
The instructions for type 1 battery chargers shall also
– specify the types, the number of batteries and the rated capacity of the batteries that can
be charged;
– include a warning against recharging non-rechargeable batteries.
The instructions for type 2 battery chargers shall also
– specify the batteries intended to be charged, such as by a catalogue number, series
identification or the equivalent;
– specify the ambient temperature range for the charger during charging.""
The instructions for battery chargers for charging automobile batteries shall include the
substance of the following:
– the battery terminal not connected to the chassis has to be connected first. The other
connection is to be made to the chassis, remote from the battery and fuel line. The battery
charger is then to be connected to the supply mains;
– after charging, disconnect the battery charger from the supply mains. Then remove the
chassis connection and then the battery connection.
