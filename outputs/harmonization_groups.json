the pressure clamping jig)\n   6) The position of the nickel particle may be determined by the cell manufacturer and the test technician\n\nf) Test Preparation and Packaging:\n   1) Disassemble the charged cell as specified in applicable procedures\n   2) Place one wound core in one zip-lock polyethylene bag, then place in one aluminum laminated bag\n   3) To minimize electrolyte vaporization,
