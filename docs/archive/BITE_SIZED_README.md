# ✅ Phase 3 - Bite-Sized for Claude Code

I broke everything into **6 tiny tasks** that Claude Code can handle one at a time.

## 📦 Files for Claude Code

### **START_HERE.md** ⭐
Give Claude Code this file first. It explains the plan and links to all tasks.

### Individual Tasks:
1. **TASK_1_REPLACE_EXTRACTION.md** - Replace extraction file (2 min)
2. **TASK_2_DISPLAY_COLUMNS.md** - Add 2 columns to UI (1 min)
3. **TASK_3_COLUMN_DEFAULTS.md** - Backward compatibility (1 min)
4. **TASK_4_REMOVE_TOGGLE.md** - Remove UI toggle (2 min)
5. **TASK_5_UPDATE_MAIN.md** - Clean up backend (2 min)
6. **TASK_6_TESTING.md** - Test everything (5 min)

**Total time:** ~15 minutes

## 🎯 How to Use with Claude Code

### Simple Approach:
```
You: "Read START_HERE.md and do each task in order"
Claude Code: [reads and starts Task 1]
Claude Code: [finishes Task 1, moves to Task 2]
... continues through all 6 tasks ...
Claude Code: [runs tests]
```

### Cautious Approach (if Claude Code struggles):
```
You: "Read and complete TASK_1_REPLACE_EXTRACTION.md only"
Claude Code: [does Task 1]
You: "Now do TASK_2_DISPLAY_COLUMNS.md"
Claude Code: [does Task 2]
... repeat for each task ...
```

---

## 📋 What Each Task Does

**Task 1:** New extraction code (better AI prompt)
**Task 2:** Show 2 new columns in results
**Task 3:** Don't break old saved data
**Task 4:** Remove old UI toggle
**Task 5:** Remove old backend code
**Task 6:** Make sure it works

---

## ✅ Success = All Tests Pass

After Task 6, if these work, you're done:
- ✅ Upload PDF
- ✅ See 9 columns (not 7)
- ✅ Export CSV works
- ✅ No crashes

---

## 🚨 If Claude Code Gets Confused

**Option 1:** Tell it to just do one task at a time
```
"Do only TASK_1, then stop and wait"
```

**Option 2:** Come back to me
```
"Task X failed with error Y"
```

## 🎁 Bonus Reference Files

If you want more context:
- **CLAUDE_CODE_HANDOFF.md** - Original mega-doc (all in one)
- **extract_ai_improved.py** - Full extraction code
- **PHASE3_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md** - Technical deep dive

But the TASK files are all you need!

## Ready to Go

4. Done! 🎉

**Each task is small, focused, and clear.**
